# Taking Screenshots ðŸ“· {#taking-screenshots}

![Example screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SkwalExe/rsfrac/main/assets/captures/Burning%20Ship/Burning%20Ship%204.jpg)

One of the main goals of this application, is creating high quality screenshots such as the one above. All the images in the [screenshots gallery ðŸŒŸ](/screenshots) were generated using the following commands, which will be explained in this section:

- `capture` (`cp`)
- `capture_fit` (`cpf`)
- `capture_hq` (`chq`)
- `capture_format` (`cf`)

The commands in parenthesis are aliases.

::: danger GPU Mode âš¡
Screenshots can take **A LOT** of time to complete.
GPU Mode can lower the computation duration from `20 hours` to `20 seconds`.
Consequently it is greatly recommended to make sure GPU Mode is enabled before starting a screenshot.
To learn more about GPU Mode, you may read the [GPU Mode section](/gpu-mode).

### `capture (cp)` {#capture}

This command is used to create a screenshot of the canvas. This is how it can be used:

- `without arguments`: in this case, the default dimensions of 1920 by 1080 pixels will be used.
- `[width] [height]`: the specified height and width will be used.

If the screenshot aspect ratio is not the same as the canvas, the height will be preserved.

### `capture_fit (cf)` {#capture-fit}

This command will take a screenshot of your canvas while maintaining the same aspect ratio.
This is how it can be used:

- `without arguments`: this will take a screenshot with a default width of 1920 pixels. The height will be adjusted to that the aspect ration is preserved.
- **`height/width [size]`**: this will take a screenshot with the specified height/width. The other dimention will be automatically adjusted.

For example, `cf width 1000` will take a screenshot with a width of 1000px and preserve the aspect ration of the canvas.

### `capture_hq (chq)` {#capture-hq}

This command takes a very high quality screenshot (**7680x4320**). It is just an alias for `capture 7680 4320`.

### `capture_format (cf)`

This command is used to change the image format used to save screenshots to the filesystem. This is how it can be used:

- `without arguments`: this will display the available file formats.
- `[file extension]`: this will select the specified file format.

For example, `cf png` will select the `PNG` format to save screenshots.
