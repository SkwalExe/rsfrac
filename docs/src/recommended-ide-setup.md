You are not required to use the tools mentioned below in your IDE.
However, keep in mind that once you finish your changes,
**your code must still conform to the project's quality standards.**

::: tip No worries ðŸ’«
You will be able to detect and correct errors automatically with the help of terminal tools,
even if you don't use any of the IDE integrations presented below.

This will be covered in a later section.

### Type-checking and formatting ðŸ¦€ {#type-checking-and-formatting}

You should use [Rust Analyzer](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/) for type-checking and formatting within the codebase.
It is recommended that you install this tool in your IDE, to benefit from automatic type-checking and formatting.
